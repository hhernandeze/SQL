-- #Spotify data analysis using SQL queries 
--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Break Into Tech
--Then created a table to analyzed the data. 

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,

track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,

liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,

--The Spotifydata.csv was then inserted into the table.
